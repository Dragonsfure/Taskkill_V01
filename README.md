# Taskkill_Py
 A light Command Line Programm that "Taskkills" a specified Task from User Input 


This was a little Script i have done one day, because one Programm kept on bugging and i always had to taskkill it instead of only closing it.
After i had a batch script closing and opening the Programm, i thought why not make it reusable and smarter for other Programms to.

This was the result, i got after  roughly 4-5 hours, with zero python knowledge at that time :D
I have ideas to improve it in the future, but that might happen with an proper UI and in another language.
